            <!-- Tips and tricks mentioned pointwise-->
            <h3>1) Make a Mind Map</h3>
            <p>Mind mapping is a process whereby you,ll literally map out the content you're planning to present using a
                visual outline. This simple step elevates your presentation by allowing you to more easily structure
                your information into a thoughtful and compelling flow. There are endless resources and mind mapping
                software you can find on online. </p>
            <h3>2)Make your presentation interesting</h3>
            <p>Just as you don't want to sit through a long presentation that solely consists of one person talking at
                you, your audience doesn't either. Save them (and yourself) from boredom by including beautiful visual
                aids. Use presentation tips for creating and videos for your deck. Your presentation will be more
                entertaining for the audience. Visual aids can serve as visual cues to help keep you on track.</p>

            <h3>3) Edit Your Content to the Most Important Points</h3>
            <p>A lot of student presenters make the mistake of saying too much about their topic. Overloading your
                slides with content results in a convoluted presentation. All of our presentation tips involve . Edit
                down your content to the main points that support your topic. Less is more in the presentation world.
                Let the visuals do more of the taking than the text.</p>
            <h3>4) Know More Than What You're Sharing</h3>
            <p>You need to be the expert in the subject you are speaking on. Collect as much information you can about your topic and read research papers.
                This will prepare you for any questions you might get from the audience.</p>
            <p>If you receive a question you don't know the answer to, don't panic! Simply say you'll look into it and
                follow-up after the presentation.</p>
            <h3>5) Make Sure to Pace Yourself</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest traps newbie presenters fall into is speaking too fast. Nerves can make it difficult
                to take your time. Our presentation tips suggest using breathing exercise to keep you calm. Rushing
                through the slides may give off the wrong impression.</p>
                <p>Effectively using pauses and silence will add impact to your speech. Take time to rehearse your pace to exude a ton of confidence and command over
                   your topic.</p>
            <h3>6) Don't be Afraid to Show Your             Personality</h3>
            <p>Students may fall into a formal and stiff style of speech during a presentation. This will result in a
                boring presentation. Make sure to show your personality.</p>
                <p>Conversation speech will make you appear
                relatable and professional. Study your audience's demographics to understand the most effective
                communications methods.</p>
            <h3>7) Don't Just Practice; Rehearse</h3>
            <p>It's not enough to know what you're going to say. You have to know how you're going to say it.It is very
                important to rehearse and keep a check on your time limit for the presentation.</p>
